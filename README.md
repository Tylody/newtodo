# TYL-TODO

Simple todo-list app following various principles of organization.

## Premise:

It is best to summarize tasks into short "to-dos," that way you can view them all and get a big picture view of your workload, as well as quickly decipher what needs to be done.

However, you may also want to store more information related to each task. Via a simple show/hide button, you can toggle task descriptions that let you switch from this big-picture view to a more granular view of each individual task.
